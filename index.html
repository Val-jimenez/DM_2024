            <h2>Project Justification</h2>
            <p>
                The selection of Kaggle's “Deutsche Bahn Delays” dataset is justified by its relevance, offering recent data on the German railway system collected in July 2024. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview, covering around 2000 stations throughout Germany with hourly information for a full week. The diverse data, including planned timetables, delays, geolocation, and station and line names, enables a comprehensive and multifaceted analysis of the railway system’s operations. Its origin in Deutsche Bahn's official APIs strongly suggests the reliability of the information. The dataset is particularly valuable for studies on punctuality, transport efficiency, and urban planning, with clear potential for practical applications in enhancing transport services. Additionally, the inclusion of stations of various categories and information on previous routes further enriches the analytical possibilities.

            <h2>Project relevance</h2>

            <p>
                The “Deutsche Bahn Delays” dataset aligns perfectly with our project's objectives, similar to the use case presented in the “Fantastic_trains_and_when_to_find_them” repository. In that project, the focus was on identifying systemic issues in rail network infrastructure using real, measured data. Similarly, our goal is to analyze Deutsche Bahn’s rail network to uncover systemic problems and inefficiencies.

This dataset offers detailed, up-to-date information on delays, schedules, and train locations throughout Germany. Its comprehensive coverage, including hourly updates over an entire week, will enable us to perform in-depth analyses of system efficiency and punctuality. The inclusion of geospatial information and train route details will facilitate the creation of informative visualizations and dashboards, akin to those in the reference project.
